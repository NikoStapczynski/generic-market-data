# Cline Rules

## Always Use Python Virtual Environment

When running Python commands or scripts in this project, always ensure the virtual environment is activated. Use `source venv/bin/activate` before executing any Python-related commands like `python`, `pip`, or running scripts.

This ensures dependencies are managed correctly and avoids system-wide installations.
